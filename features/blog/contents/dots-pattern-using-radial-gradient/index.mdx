## Introduction

Have you ever wondered about creating the dotted pattern you see on the homepage? Well, it's actually done using a neat CSS background image gradient. In this post, I'll walk you through the steps to make that pattern yourself.

## The Concept

For those who don't know, this is the type of pattern that we want to achieve only using pure CSS.

<SimpleGradient />

The concept here is to utilize <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient" target='_blank' rel='noreferer noopener'>`radial-gradient`</a> background image. A radial gradient will produce a gradient in a form of a circle like this.

<RadialGradient />

This gradient can be achieved using this CSS code

```css
.dot {
  background-image: radial-gradient(powderblue 20px, transparent 0px);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: 50px 50px;
  background-position: center;
}
```

The dot radius size is determined by the first value that we passed in to the `radial-gradient`. In this case, the dot is `40px` wide. As for the `50px`, it denotes the background size as I show this with the purple background.

After knowing how to create a dot, the next step is to repeat those gradient. We can change the `background-repeat` value to `repeat`. In fact, `repeat` is the _default_ value for `background-repeat`.

<BackgroundRepeat />

```css
.dots {
  background-image: radial-gradient(powderblue 20px, transparent 0px);
  background-repeat: repeat; /* or omit this declaration */
  background-size: 50px 50px;
  background-position: center;
}
```

However, this is too large, we can set the dot radius size and background size even smaller.

<BackgroundRepeat dot={1} size={30} />

```css
.dots {
  background-image: radial-gradient(powderblue 1px, transparent 0px);
  background-repeat: repeat; /* or omit this declaration */
  background-size: 30px 30px;
  background-position: center;
}
```
